### Credit Card Approval System

#### Brief Description
This project involves the development of a credit card approval system that identifies and analyzes factors influencing the approval or rejection of credit card applications. 
The system leverages SQL for data exploration and Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and preprocessing. Data was imported into mysql using data import wizard.

#### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a robust and efficient credit card approval system by:
1. Identifying key factors that affect the approval of credit card applications.
2. Exploring and analyzing the data using SQL to uncover patterns and relationships.
3. Cleaning and preparing the data using Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency.
4. Developing a model using python to understand the likelihood of approval for new applications.

This project aims to streamline the credit card approval process, enhance decision-making accuracy, and improve overall customer satisfaction by making the approval process more transparent and data-driven.
